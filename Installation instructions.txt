The code works with Python 3 tested in Linux, but should work in Windows and Mac with Python 3 installed.
The code works in a closed environment.

Only the library qt4 needs to be installed, all the rest are part of standard library. Library Installation, type in the command line:

sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt4


Installation instructions:
-Unzip the files
-Using the command line, go to the folder where files are located.

Starting the server:
-Type: python3 server.py

Starting the peers GUI:
-Type: python3 p1.py
-Type: python3 p2.py
-Type: python3 p3.py
etc

Starting the peer client_console:

It will ask for name:

I enabled a server at home for testing at IP 46.7.61.198 port 9876
It may work depending on your firewall.
